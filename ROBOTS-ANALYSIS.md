## Explanation

The Daily Pennsylvanian's robots.txt file sets rules for web crawlers accessing its site. It allows all bots to crawl the entire website but enforces a 10-second crawl delay, likely to reduce server strain. However, it explicitly blocks SemrushBot from accessing any content, preventing it from collecting SEO-related data.
